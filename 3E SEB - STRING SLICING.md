## SEB - STRING SLICING

### AIM  
To write a Python function that accepts a string and prints the characters located between positions 2 and 7 (inclusive) of that string. Positions are indexed starting from 0.

### ALGORITHM
1.Input the String: Accept a string input from the user.
2.Check String Length: Ensure the string has at least 7 characters. If the string is shorter, print an error message indicating that there are insufficient characters.
3.Extract the Substring: Slice the string to extract the characters from index 2 to index 7. (Index 8 is exclusive in Python string slicing, so input_string[2:8] is used.)
4.Print the Substring: Print the extracted substring.
5.End: Terminate the function.

### PROGRAM
def slice(name):
    print(f"The sliced string is '{name[2:7]}'")

### RESULT
Thus, Python function that accepts a string and prints the characters located between positions 2 and 7 (inclusive) of that string. Positions are indexed starting from was implemeted and successfully executed.
